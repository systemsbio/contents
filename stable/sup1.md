=============================================
self evalution, perhaps reframe some questions and this might be useful?
# BioFrameworks

### What foundational models and metaphors should any
new student of biology be exposed to understand a
genome-enabled biology, medicine, or environmental biology?

### What should a trainee know about basic theory and
foundational models of biological processes?

### What should a trainee know about extending basic theory
and models with statistically-testable hypotheses?

## III. Data Discovery Processes

### What should a trainee know about the following:
  a) statistical Design of Experiments (DOE)
  b) design and automation of larger-scale experimental processes and analytical technologies;
  c) computer-assisted acquisition and management of observations
  d) electronic archiving of data processing steps to ensure repeatable research?


## II. Bioinformation Technology

### What should a
trainee know
about existing
technology for
a particular
application area
within biology,
medicine,
biotechnology,
environmental
studies,
etc?

## I. Information Technology

### What should a
trainee know
about information
technology for
*any* science or
data-intensive
application?

## Five
Families
of
theory &
models,
organized
by
questions

### A. How do molecular biology and biomolecular processes work within cells?

### B. How do physiological processes and signalling among cells work?

### C. How do developmental biology processes work (i.e. change in molecular,
physiological and cellular processes, over developmental or organismal time)?

### D. How do population genetics and other population biology processes work?

### E. How do all of the prior processes change over evolutionary time?
