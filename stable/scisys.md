Scientific Systems in Biological Thought and Practice

Technology-assisted Humboldtian science:

Four current paradigms of doing science: observation, theory, computational sciences (theories, mathematical models, + computers), informatics (observation, statistical models, + computers)

The scientific method vs. scientific methods

Historical themes in philosophy of science (e.g. Bacon, Popper and falsification, Kuhn and paradigms, etc)

Nature of science, including the following:

Basic Science vs applied science (esp. the applications of biology to medicine and agriculture)

Epistemology and ontology

The logic of deduction, induction, abduction, and inference to best explanation.
Often, in physical sciences, methods based on theory and deductive logic are widely deployed.
In biological sciences, observation, inference to best explanation or inductive logic are often deployed.
Too few hypotheses and the problems of confirmation bias and weak inference in lab-based experimental methods.
Too many hypotheses and the problems of p-hacking and data dredging in methods for informatics and clinical research.

Observation, models, hypothesis, and theory.
Historical themes in philosophy of science (e.g. Bacon, Popper and falsification, Kuhn and paradigms, Platt and Strong Inference, etc)

Hypotheses, testing, and the design of experiments in basic science, informatics, clinical sciences, etc. (while Avoiding confirmation bias, weak inference, and p-hacking with too few or two many hypotheses
Humboldtian science, technology, and the (now) four paradigms for doing science: observation, theory, computational science, and informatics (the latter two needed modern computers).

History of biological thought and practice, including the following:
A taxonomy of biological observation: species concepts, gene concepts, and other classification of biological parts.
Problems and progress in biological thought, including essentialism, explanations, typology, population thinking, teleology, trees, constructivism, and other topics.
Four Aristotelian questions and four Tinbergian questions
Great Chain of Being-tinged mindset of ``progress'' vs a mindset with evolutionary tree branching, randomized ``drunkard's walk'' and ``black swan'' events. (?remember the metaphor/story in that branches in evolutionary trees are more like Joshua's trees being accidently blocked by external forces and forced to diverge, than directed branching, as in normal trees.)
Discovery of biological machinery and the historical foundation of current biological disciplines.

Current scientific and socioeconomic systems, including the following:
Systems for basic research, scholarship, and education.
Systems for applied biomedical research, clinical research and medical practice.
Systems for applied research and practice in nutrition, food science, biotechnology, and agriculture.

# The Four
Frameworks of
Science

## I. Observation

## II. Theory

## III. Simulations


## IV. Informatics



### Origins and Concepts

- Classifying and Correlating
- Measuring with Instruments
Observation + Analytical Technology
- Experimental Method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Two Legs of Scientific Progress, 20th century and earlier

	- Theory

		- Deductive Logic

	- Observation

		- Inductive Logic
		- Humboldtian Science, Instruments, and Analytical Technology
		- Design of Experiments (e.g. R. Fisher)

- Four Legs of Science (mid 20th century, now, or in future)

	- Theory

		- Conceptual and Computational Models in Carbonware

			- primarily inductive logic with theoretical models embedded by past education

	- Simulation and Prediction (NEW)

		- Conceptual and Computational Models in Siliconware

			- Models embedded in Technological Systems, esp. computational technology
			- Primarily uses an inductive logic embedded in software
			- Models and logic (and their shortcomings) often hidden from and unexamined by the carbonware-users

		- In biology, also  Retrodiction by phylogenetic reconstruction

			- a very powerful approach with a broad applications in most areas of biology
			- e.g. almost all *current* "functional annotation" of genes/proteins in databases are based on simulating/retrodicting past history
very few proteins are "proved" to have a function (e.g. purified/isolated and shown to have protein kinase activity and other data; instead most "protein kinases" are annotated as such merely because they are computationally predicted to be a homolog to the very few "proven" protein kinases)

	- Observation

		- Data Models used in Classification and Statistical Models (Carbonware-driven)
		- Current Process Models and Paradigms in Experimental Methods (Carbonware-driven)
		- Primarily, Inductive logic to generate and test hypothetical Models from (smallish) sets of data

	- Informatics and Data_intensive Science

### Why Models?

- Technology is built from models

	- Engineering of software is preceded by data models and process models in minds of the developers.
	- Use of software and other technologies depends on both the models in the minds of developers and on a second set of models in the mind of users.

- Obervation and Data acquisition is built from models
- Experimentation is built from models
- Prediction and practical applications of biology is build from models

### Data Models for Biologists
What patterns in data are (hoped to be) informative to thinking by biologists?
*Patterns* that biologists see (often, with aid of statistics)

==========================


- The foundations, technology, and thought for scientific advances

	- Past: Science *once* advanced upon two legs

		- Observation and inductive logic
		- Theory and deductive logic

	- Recent Past and Present: Technology and Applied Math advanced a larger-scale observational science (after Humboldt, Fisher, et al)

		- Larger-scale measurements and observations (aka Humboldtian science)

			- Analytical Technology and instruments can accumulate observations that are more global and, ultimately, systems-scale

				- Voyages of discovery, by ships to see what is around the world (e.g. Humboldt  and his instruments for measurements)
				- Voyages of discovery, by microscopes and other instruments to see what is invisible to the unaided eye, but around us all. (from microscopes, to DNA sequencers, mass spectrometers, and other modern instruments and analytical technology

		- Experiments, as an efficient means of observation (aka Fisher, et al)

			- Statistical Design of Experiments
			- Frequentist statistics, applied to experimental observations

	- Present and Future: A more systems-scale science now can advance on four legs (after WWII and invention of electronic computers and associated technology)

		- I. Observation
		- II..Theory
		- III. Compute-intensive, computer-supported simulation and prediction

			- Third paradigm of science, as per Ken Wilson et al.

				- Initially applied to physics problems of atomic physics, weather forecasting, etc.

			- Theory plus computational technology, mathematical modeling, computational science and deductive logic
			- Thought/Logic employed by carbonware and siliconware

				- Mainly deductive logic that allows for prediction from general, theoretical models

					- In biology, a subcase of deductive logic and evolutionary theory allows for* *retrodiction* of a natural history of species and genes.  Most genome and sequence analysis and gene function information in databases have aspects of retrodictive phylogenetic reconstruction that are driven from evolutionary models (e.g. different Dayhoff scoring matrices in BLAST employ different models of molecular evolution)

		- IV. Data-Intensive, computer supported informatics and Knowledge Discovery from Databases

			- Fourth paradigm of science, as per Jim Gray et al
			- Observation plus informational technology, applied statistics, and data science

				- More efficient observations and experiments permit systems-scale observation

					- Statistical Design of Experiments (DOE)
					- QA/QC/QI  Error analysis, Juran Triangle, Deming, et al
					- Automation of data processing
					- Database Management

						- e.g. OLTP vs. OLAP/KDE
