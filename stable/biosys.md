# Biological Systems in Organisms and Populations

===== OUTLINE ==================================================================

Biology's part list: Genes, Gene Products, metabolites, and other biochemical parts.

The past of biological systems as inferred from fossils, biological sequences, and phylogenetics.

Up until the 1980s, this past of Natural History was largely inferred from fossilized body plans,
Natural History of Phenotypes, Forms, and Fossils

  - Fossils and Natural History
  - Comparative Morphology and Embryology
  - Comparative Biochemistry


Today that past can be further fleshed out thanks to more recently available biological sequences.

  - Natural History of Biosequences

  - Natural History of Gene Regulatory Networks and Cell Signalling Networks



The past of ancient genes and the evolutionary emergence of complex biological systems, as inferred with genome sequence analysis and phylogenetics.


Transformation of matter, energy, and information in biological networks.

The whole is greater than the sum of parts: Complexity emerges from systems of networked parts.

Physiological and cybernetic control systems of molecular, cellular, metabolic, and signaling networks.

Embryological and other self-organizing systems that can create body plans and other phenotypes from genotypes.

Various complex adaptive systems in physiology and evolutionary biology
Complex adaptive systems in biology, such as the following:
(1) adaptive immune system, (plus the innate...) ,
(2) adaptation in physiology and neurobiology; metabolic regulatory networks, neural circuits, large-scale brain networks, etc.
(3) evolutionary biology
Biological systems acting in population genetics, population biology, and microevolution.
