- A Brief Definition

	- Many Diverse Complex Systems share common features: Agents with Rules, Local Information/Signals, and Networked Agents

		- Complexity emerges from Networked Agents, their internal rules and the information and resources exchanged among rhose Agents.

			- AGENT: A type of component, with some independence of action

				- ex1: agent--a cell in an organism
				- ex2: agent--an organism in a population
				- ex3: agent--a health care provider, patient or other person in health care

			- RULES: Each individual Agent has some internal "if-then" Rules

				- ex1: Rules--genome-encoded rules for cells, molecules, or organisms
				- ex2: Rules--physical or chemical constraints and drivers on cellular and organismal functions
				- ex3: Rules--standards of care for a care provider in medicine
				- ex4: Rules--Design of experiments and logical analysis for a researcher

			- INFORMATION: The rules in an object use "Local Information" or "signals" around each object to vary the internal functions and external outputs of each object

				- ex1: Local Information--hormones or other signals seen and output by cells and molecules
				- ex2: Local Information--Specific results from clinical instruments, patient history, symptoms in health care.
				- Ex 3: Local Information--Results observed by a basic R and D worker.

			- NETWORKS: Objects interact in networks, in large part by exchanging Local Information/signals or resources.

				- Ex1: Gene Regulatory Networks (mainly exchanging signal information)
				- Ex2: Cell Signalling Networks (mainly exchanging signal information)
				- Ex3: Social Networks in feeding, fleeing, fighting, and reproducing (mainly exchanging behavioural and other information across organisms)
				- Ex4: Metabolic Networks (within organism) and Food Webs (across ecosystems) (mainly exchanging matter and energy)
				- Ex5: Health care networks of Professionals, Patients, Hospitals, Insurance providers, etc (mainly exchanging data (signals) money and human resources data )

			- EMERGENT COMPLEXITY:

# Complexity
and the
Critical
Thinking
for
Systems-Scale
Biology


## Essential Complexity

### The intrinsic complexity of biosystems,
their networked processes, and objects
*What Biosystems know and do*

## Accidental Complexity

### The complexity that is accidental/incidental to
human processes and technologies that
observe, understand, advance, and apply
a biology for large, complex biosystems
*What Biologists know and do*
and just...
"What past biologists knew and did"

## Six "Thinking Hats"

### Observation

- Systems-wide observation has extensive accidental complexity; Biologists doing systems-scale data measurement and analyses have a daunting array of complex procedures, analytical instruments, software, databases, and other things they must "chain" together. These processes. tools, and technologies are often poorly integrated and rarely automated.
- While making systems-wide observations *might* reveal additional and previously unappreciated essential complexities and highlight more subtle patterns in the data, observational biology, itself, does not alter the underlying and true essential complexity of biosystems.

One is unlikely to *just* "observe" or "pattern-find" large data sets and find your way to a simpler biological understanding.

### Technology

- Re-engineered or New technology and tools may minimize accidental complexity of systems-scale observation and analysis
- Technology primarily affects accidental complexity; it does not alter the essential complexity of biosystems.
One is unlikely to just engineer or "technologize" your way to a simpler biological understanding.
- Technology may have accidental complexity of past paradigms hidden inside it. These tools were often constructed in the past with design models that did not even deal with the essential complexity that was then known, let alone current theory and, thus, often make difficult uncovering the true complexity.

### Biological Theory

- Theory includes our most current view of the essential complexity of biosystems and its internal processes
- Often, both current theory and patterns in current observation may not appreciate important essential complexity of the processes of biosystems
- In the past, all major advances and "simplifications" in biological understanding were ultimately theoretical in nature: Darwin-Wallace theory; Mendelian theory, chromosome theory, cell theory, Neo-Darwinian theory, neutral molecular evolution theory, "Central Dogma" and genome information theory, etc.

### Complex Systems

- There are shared features in the Essential complexity of biological, physical, and social complex systems.
- Some of these features are not always well appreciated in the working paradigms of some biologists

  e.g. the complexity that can emerge from objects that have simple internal rules and where execution of those rules depends upon local information near those objects (e.g. the complexity of ant nests and ant behaviour does not rely on a single central command and control object (i.e. there is no chief engineer-ant *for* a structure), but the complexity builds when each ant acts upon simple rules and local information that each ant encounters. Somewhat related to this, If a biologist uses "the gene for X" phrase where X is anything other than a simple gene product or gene region for regulatory logic, they may be assuming a central, single engineer-gene where one probably does not exist; complex phenotypes are often the result of a network of genes, gene products, cellular machinery, and organismal machinery acting upon genome-encoded rules and local information. Even the rare single locus Mendelian diseases use a network of many interacting gene products to actually construct the final disease phenotype and, at a practical level, effective treatments often involve considering objects, rules and local information in this network. A simple observed pattern does *not* mean there was a simple process that was ultimately responsible "for" the pattern. I posit if one wants to find a path to the best "simplicity" in biosystems, then thinking about rules and local information that create complex biosystems processes will prove more durable--over the long term--than thinking with simplistic patterns that assume a single observed object is wholly responsible "for" complex phenomena and their patterns)

### Pattern Models

- Often, this includes a useful but wrong "greedy reductionism" of the essential complexity for some past application of the biosciences; however, these "greedy reductionisms" may fail when applied systems-wide.

### Biosystem Process Models

- Sometimes our current grasp of essential complexity of biosystem processes is inadequate for systems-wide deduction
- In particular, the bioinformatics type I--the essential complexity of developmental and physiological regulatory and signal processing networks--is revealed, to a large part, by the evolution of that information processing. This area of what is informative to biology at evolutionary, physiological, and developmental time scale is underappreciated, underfunded, and usually falls between most current bioscience departments.

AGENTS, not objects
# Complexity in SYSTEMS may arise from
OBJECTS processing LOCAL INFORMATION with RULES

## In biosystems, OBJECTS may include the objects directly encoded by genomes--such as enzymes, structural proteins, RNA, and genomic regulatory elements. Other objects may include the metabolites indirectly built up by networked pathways that involve enzymes.  Other biosystem objects may include additional items--such as cells and organisms--that are indirectly built by complex networked processes that involve genome-encoded objects, metabolites, other organisms, and nonbiotic objects found in the environment.

## In biosystems, RULES often--but not always--involve the genome-encoding that directs the
complex networks of interacting proteins, cis-regulatory elements, and other objects

### an example of a non-genome "rule" may be in forming and maintaining much of cellular membranes; the basic lipid bilayers can self-organize in construction and repair without directions of any genome-encoded objects. Genomes may direct enzymes to make specialized phospholipids, but phospholipids themselves may self-organize into bilayers without genome direction of that assembly.  Another set of "rules" may be invoked in some morphogenesis during development.  Some folding of tissues may involve partial use of rules that derive more from geometry and biophysical constraints or drivers than from micro-controlling genome encoded rules--but genome rules for development do--of course--take advantage of these constraints and drivers.

## In biosystems, LOCAL INFORMATION might be signals of various kinds.

### Signals for molecular objects

- In molecular biology, local information might be signals such as ligands that can bind to allosteric sites in proteins, transcription factors that bind to cis-regulatory elements in DNA, or other objects that interacts or modifies the molecule.

### Signals for cellular and subcellular objects

- In cellular biology, local information might be signals like hormones, neurotransmitters, morphogens, selected metabolites, secondary messengers, etc.
- In this course, we will focus most attention at this level

### Signals for organisms

- In organismal biology and above, local information might be signals
 that an organism can sense and that may lead to that organism
