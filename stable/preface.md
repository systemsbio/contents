**Data deluge in basic science.** In the last few decades, the science of biology has changed dramatically.
One of those changes has been the shear amount of data that is now available to a biologist.
Some of this increase in data is due to advances in data-acquiring technologies.
These technologies---like genomics, proteomics, and RNA transcript analysis---increasingly employed in labs take an "whole-system" approach to data gathering.
In the past, for example, many molecular biology publications were about one gene or protein.
The published experiments would often provide simple yes-or-no answers that required no statistics.
In contrast, now there are new instruments that quickly generate complex data about thousands of genes, proteins, or metabolites.
The data volume and complexity pose several problems. One is it requires more extensive and advanced use of statistics to obtain any answers at all from high volume data.

**Reproducible research.** Aside from some researchers needing to brush up on long-forgotten statistics, the biggest problem to the recent data deluge is probably that large data-driven research is often difficult to reproduce.
Managing and analyzing large data sets with complicated mix of software makes it difficult for a researcher to even document what they did.
