# Introduction to Systems in biology




=============================
TODO move following to inside respective parts


## Biological Systems: Parts, Past, Patterns, and Processes.

### Biological parts have a past.

The cyanobacteria shown in panel a in figure TODO{link} have had a complex and exceedingly long history.
But then all living things have an equally long history, as all living things are thought to have come from a common ancestor. This ancestor, called the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA), is thought to have lived about 3.8 Billion years ago.
The patterns in this distant past were often unknown to us, but were partially revealed by fossilized structures, such as these stromatolites.
The gaps in the pattern are because, in part, some creatures do not fossilize well.
Stromatolites are the rare example of unicellular organisms leaving behind large fossils.
Even for animals with hard parts like bones, fossilization events are uncommon.
Lastly, preservation of fossils over hundreds of million of years may be rarer still.

 <figcaption>Panel {a} shows several cyanobacteria, magnified 300x under a light microscope.
 The current cyanobacteria, formerly known as blue-green alga, are thought to be remarkably similar to very ancient organisms.
 Panel (b) shows structures called stromatolites that are found along the shores
 of Lake Thetis in Western Australia. Stromatalites are formed by the interactions of sedimentary grains with biofilms (microbial mats) of microorganisms, especially cyanobacteria. Some fossilized stromatalites are thought to be over a billion years old; others are more recent.

\caption{This is a micrograph of Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacterium. Many biologists have chosen to study E. coli as a general model for living things. This bacteria can be a normal resident of our digestive tracts. However, E. coli and its close relatives are sometimes responsible for outbreaks of disease. In this micrograph, the bacterium is visualized using a scanning electron microscope and digital colorization.

Fortunately, we can very often fill in these gaps in the patterns with a second and independent line of evidence that has become available to us.
There is a common thread of DNA that runs through all living things
Thanks to modern genome-scale DNA sequencing, we often have gene and genome sequences from many organisms.
Thanks to advances in molecular evolutions and phylogenetics, we can often trace patterns in these biological sequences.
As two of the pioneers in molecular evolution put it, genes are documents of evolutionary history. (TOCITE Pauling and ZUckerkandel)
We may not be able to reach all the way back to LUCA and 3.8 Billion years ago, but we connect up organisms over hundreds of millions of years.
We can now cluster together groups and create evolutionary trees from this line of evidence.
Not only can we often confirm patterns inferred from fossils, but we can also infer new trees and more detailed patterns.

The current organisms contain elements from the past---genes. These elements can help us see the broad patterns and help us make connections among many species.
In a somewhat similar fashion, the thinking of current biologists can contain elements from the past---theories, paradigms, and research agendas. and those elements can help in finding patterns and connecting ideass across in broad areas of biological investigations.

## Scientific Systems: People, Past, and Processes in basic and applied science.

fig palto vs aristotle essentialist vs accidental properties.
fig. Aggasiz, concrete and abstract. esp. concrete data vs. abstract ideas
difficult to place yourself in mind of louis, but he may have believed the abstract patterns he created in his mind were more "concrete" and "essential" to biology than they really where , rather than evolutionary accidents that had a several  billion year history.  The danger of reifying abstract patterns in data

fig. e.coli, lab/petri dish, patient in icu, cow, spinach: a thread in how a modest microorganism can have
 profound impacts in systems of basic science, medical applications, agriculture, and food.

sec. Information Systems: Parts, Information, and the differences that make a difference.
example of dodo: objectively new predators introduced on island were a threat, but probably lost ability to see them as threat.  long distant relatives may have proccessed their presense as informative and made a difference in behaviour dodos probbly did not lose ability to see the predaators, but probably lost the ability to see them as a threat nd inform their actions. .

data is just data unless it leads biologists to something like an inference, prediction, or practical application.

As we will explore in Part B: Scientific Systems, the intellectual history of how we came to TODO{finish thought}

understand the natural history of fossils and, later, understand the evolution of genes were two foundations for much of current biological thought.
More broadly a grounding in the history and philosophy of science

use ecoli to note how a simple, lowly bacteria can have impacts on many complex systems

TODO{rework}
What is biology? In simple terms, biology is the study of life. This is a very broad definition because the scope of biology is vast. Biologists may study anything from the microscopic or submicroscopic view of a cell to ecosystems and the whole living planet. Listening to the daily news, you will quickly realize how many aspects of biology we discuss every day.
