abstract models and Technology# Technology can  expand the size and complexity of systems that can be analyzed: however problems are common in the use of technology. Proposed solutions to these problems often--and inappropriately--focus on ENGINEERING or APPLYING a "better" technology. However,  most of these problems are often ultimately derived from the MODELING that is required before one can apply technology or engineer tools.  Even if not formally specified, informal mental models in minds drive technology use and engineering. For example, the models that are embedded during training of carbonware (i.e. educating students) and building siliconware (i.e.programming software) are often merely "working paradigms" for biology subspecialities that fail as system scope and observations broaden.  These working paradigms are not theoretical models of broader range of application...but even broad theoretical models may have boundary conditions beyond which they fail. Worse, in real world engineering the DESIGN MODELS and implementation often must make compromises; implementation within time and budget may require engineers to jettison even some well-known complexity.  Often users are uniformed about even these known simplifications in models.

## Trilemma of Real-world Design Models in Engineering Tools

### Good

### Fast

### Cheap

## Trilemma of Theoretical Models (e.g. Levins)

### Generality

### Precision

### Realism

## Diverse problems with statistical data models, for example...
(N.B. some of the listed problems to the right do overlap)

### Type I errors

### Type II errors

### Data patterns of correlation may *imply* causative processes to people, but are not informative about the actual processes within systems: when in large, complex systems, one may often discover many "interesting" correlations that are ultimately uninformative, false, or misleading on causation.

### The problem of induction: a large, complex system may often contain previously unobserved "rara avis" of "black swans";
Example, consider clinical trials with circa 100 patients but there are circa 7 billion unique human genotypes

### The curse of dimensionality, esp. relevant for ANY complex and multidimensional system

### Simpson's Paradox (error in "merging" large data sets)

### Data dredging (error in "dividing" large data sets and false discovery)

### Repeatable research, the half life of facts, and the decline effect

### "Most published research findings are [statistically] false" --John Ioannidis et al.

## Problems in People Process Models, Use Cases,  and Management

### Problem of Repeatable Research in larger-scale research, where many discovery processes may be obscured by automated and often hidden technology

### Automation and Quality of Data Discovery Processes

- e.g Scientific "Business Process Reengineering" required for system-scale work (e.g. often must replace 'tried and "true"' earlier methods embedded during carbonware training

### Problems of Software and System Engineering


- There is no Technological Silver Bullet to slay the monster of essential biocomplexity
(compare with "No Silver Bullet" essay of Fred Brooks)

note fred brooks and essential complexity in software ...


- Note: often the people that know the most robust scientific models best are often different from the people that know the technology and design models best
- Worse, many experimentalists mainly know working models and paradigms best; these are neither design models, nor, often, robust, generally-applicable theoretical models
- Note: engineered tools carry with them limitations of design, theoretical, and statistical models (i.e. technological tools are model-laden)
- Note: often people are not aware of the subtle problems in scientific models and informal paradigms they are using in engineering and using technology
- Note: paradigm-laden engineering, or worse "curiosity driven" engineering, often creates tools that have unhelpful accidental complexity and that miss required essential biosystem complexity

### There are "people processes" in both engineering and applying technological tools.  These might be the user processes for a single "typical" user or, collectively, the networked processes across an entire research or application enterprise.  These processes may need to be modeled, at least informally. To actually apply useful technological tools, the tools must fit within and help automate the processes of people in Research-Discovery or Practical Application Enterprises. Good engineering of tools may analyze potential users and from this system analysis create people-process models and use cases that could be used in tool design. ( i.e. prioritizing among the prior trilemmas and problems.) Usually for rapidly evolving and poorly-financed scientific tools, this analysis needs to be "lightweight" and is often very informal or ad hoc.  The management and engineering of complex technologies and tools, themselves, also often requires robust considerations of models of "people processes" in software and technology engineering (e.g. one may  engineer problems with a waterfall model, agile development, pair programming, or other models; e.g. what are the methods you would use to turn ideas and user needs into software code?. (Not considering models or formal software methodologies--say, a "curiosity-driven" software engineering-- *is* a type of methodology with many risks)

## Problems in Technological System Complexity

### Accidental complexity, design, engineering and use of a tool

### Accidental Complexity across different tools

### Essential Complexity of the Natural system or Social System under study

### Greedy Reductionism of Essential Complexity

### Modularity, Flexibility, and Usability

## Problems in Technology and Supporting Models

## Modeling
