* Information Systems for Biology and Biologists
=======================================================================================
Information systems for biology vs. information systems for a biologist.
In considering what data might be most useful to collect and analyze, it is likely wise to first consider what is likely most informative in biological organisms
What is informative to biology?
(1) Gene and Gene Product sequences
(2) Physiological Signals such as hormones, morphogens, neurotransmitters, pheromones, selected metabolites, etc
(3) Signal-processing networks (e.g. gene regulatory networks, cell-cell signaling networks, neural and neuroendocrine networks, quorum sensing, etc.)

What is informative to a biologist?
(1) Systems for research and scholarship transactions of a biologist and their collaborators (e.g. electronic notebooks, automation of routine steps, reproducible research methods, versioned writing, versioned code, versioned datasets, integration of writing, code and data into a publication, etc).
This is likely to be assisted by versioning software such as Git and GitHub.
Automation may use shell scripts or other programming.
Only for very large data sets with many possible updates or other transactions, one may also want to add relational databases or other formal database management systems (DBMS).
If the data set is largely stable and largely is processed in one direction in a data analysis tool chain, then a DBMS may be too heavyweight to be efficient.
While paper notebooks may be useful to many, the very nature of a systems biology approach means that a paper  notebook, by itself, is likely inadequate.  (analogy to business OLTP?)
(2) Systems for analysis of data or computation (e.g. Domain-specific scientific software, R and Rstudio, Pandas/Python, Matlab, GNU Octave, etc.)  (analogy to business OLAP?)
(3) Systems for using community information, such as publications, reproducible open science, and community databases. (e.g. Pubmed, Genbank, PDB, Genome Browsers, etc.)
volutioon of information systems for biologists. index cards of linneaus, correspondence of Darwin, et al.
(4) New systems involving parts of the first three that promote reproducible research, open sciences, and robust published results. Information systems and reproducible research e.g. https://www.one-tab.com/page/oHxt5pqDTbG_cm-biPz_CA
Evevntually, most results were to be found only in peer-reviewed publications.
In some cases, the data sets becae too large for paper-based publication, Community databases, like Genbank, began to be set up to store some data together. T  In the cases of biological sequences and protein structures, many paper-based publications began to insist that these biological data was submitted to these community databases. These community databases, however, have encountered many problems when
Probably explore some NCBI resources, EBI resources, Galaxy, genome browsers, Ubuntu sci packages, as examples
Date Integration in human-engineered information systems by exploiting Natural keys and 'informativeness' in  evolution-created natural systems.

### Information and Biocomplexity--as seen as a Bioinformation Tapestry





{Tapestry] is composed of two sets of interlaced threads, those running parallel to the length (called the warp) and those parallel to the width (called the weft); the warp threads are set up under tension on a loom, and the weft thread is passed back and forth across part or all of the warps. Tapestry is weft-faced weaving, in which all the warp threads are hidden in the completed work...  In tapestry weaving, weft yarns are typically discontinuous; the artisan interlaces each coloured weft back and forth in its own small pattern area. It is a plain weft-faced weave having weft threads of different colours worked over portions of the warp to form the design. (1)
